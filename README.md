## Goal
Use CODVID-19 API (Documentation using postman) to build mobile application that displays:</br>
* CODVID cases per country on a MAP</br>
* CODVID cases per country Live on a MAP (changes)</br>
* CODVID cases per country based on a date.</br>
* Summary of total cases for the world</br>
* Live Summary for the World</br>
## Stretch goal:
* Display data per Province</br>
* User can put their address and track CODVID-19 in their neighborhood (Only in countries where regional data is provided)</br>


## Goal for Step 4
On separate branch, exercise the CODVID-19 API (Documentation using postman) and display the data in your application as text. 

## Result of Step 4
Because I don't have an Android phone, so I used two simulator for test.</br>

</br>
I am still working on to show the cases on map...

## Goal for Step 5
Overlay the data on the maps.</br>

## Result of Step 5
Now I am able to show all the cases for different Countries and areas on the map, without manually add.
I used an iOS emulator and an Android emulator to test.</br>
There is a marker for all the Countries and areas, users can click any of them to see the total confrimed cases of the Country.</br>
